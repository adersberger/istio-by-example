# Istio Playground

![fit](../logo.png)

@adersberger @qaware

^ Istio service mesh is a thrilling new tech that helps getting a lot of technical stuff out of your microservices (circuit breaking, observability, mutual-TLS, ...) into the infrastructure - for those who are lazy (aka productive) and want to keep their microservices small. Come one, come all to the Istio playground: (1) we provide a ready-to-use Kubernetes cluster (2) we guide you through the installation of Istio (3) we bring a small Spring Cloud sample application (4) we provide assistance in the case you get stuck ... and it's up to you to explore and tinker with Istio on your own paths and with your own pace.

# Why?

---

![fit](../img/book.png)

^ 
Istio and service meshes are a hype right now
Our job is to ground this hype by providing real-life use cases

---

# Atomic Architecture
![](../img/molecules.jpg)

---

![](../img/adersberger-istio-by-example/adersberger-istio-by-example.001.jpeg)

^ 
microservice applications do have a lot of crosscutting concerns to address to be cloud native

---
![](../img/adersberger-istio-by-example/adersberger-istio-by-example.002.png)

^ 
these concerns can be addressed by libraries

---
# Library Bloat
![](../img/adersberger-istio-by-example/adersberger-istio-by-example.002.png)

^ 
but this leads to a library bloat

![](../img/adersberger-istio-by-example/adersberger-istio-by-example.006.png)

^ 
so the idea is to move those concerns from the application side to the infrastructure side

---

![](../img/adersberger-istio-by-example/adersberger-istio-by-example.007.png)

^ 
and this is where Istio comes up:
It unburdens cloud native applications to address crosscutting concerns by themselves.

#Setting the Sails with Istio 1.0

^ 
now let's dig into Istio - example by example
first task is to setup a Istio mesh

---
![](../img/istio-arch.png)

^ 
 * Pilot: Watches services and transforms this information in a canonical platform-agnostic model. The envoy configuration is then derived from this canonical model. Exposes the Rules API to add traffic management rules (used by Istioctl).
 * Envoy: Sidecar proxy per microservice that handles ingress/egress traffic
 * Mixer: Policy / precondition checks and telemetry. Highly scalable. Envoy caches policy rules and buffers telemetry data locally.
 https://istio.io/blog/2017/mixer-spof-myth.html
 * Ingress/Egress: Inbound and outbound gateway. Nothing more than an managed Envoy.
 * Citadel: CA for service-to-service authx and encryption. Certs are delivered as a secret volume mount. Workload identity is provided by SPIFFE.

# Deploy Istio

 ```zsh

# label default namespace to be auto-sidecarred
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection

# Deploy Sample Application (BookInfo)

```zsh
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/kube/bookinfo.yaml

# Deploy Sample Application (BookInfo)

kubectl get pods
istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml

```

__Hint: Since Istio release 0.8 you can substitute `istioctl` with `kubectl`. We're still using `istioctl` for clarity purposes.__

# Sample Application: BookInfo[^1]

![inline](../img/bookinfo-arch.png)

[^1]: Istio BookInfo Sample (https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo) 

^
The BookInfo sample application deployed is composed of four microservices:

1) The productpage microservice is the homepage, populated using the details and reviews microservices.
2) The details microservice contains the book information.
3) The reviews microservice contains the book reviews. It uses the ratings microservice for the star rating. Default: load-balance between versions.
4) The ratings microservice contains the book rating for a book review.

The deployment included three versions of the reviews microservice to showcase different behaviour and routing:

1) Version v1 doesnâ€™t call the ratings service.
2) Version v2 calls the ratings service and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
3) Version v3 calls the ratings service and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

The services communicate over HTTP using DNS for service discovery.

Login is allowed with any combination of username and password.

now let's stimulate the sample application and have a look on what we can observe
with this stack in place you're now able to play around with Istio
I'm coming to an end by flipping through the toys you can use. Key bindings:
q, ctrl-c - quit
r - reset stats
k - increase rate by 100 RPS
j - decrease rate by 100 RPS

# Canary Releases: A/B Testing

 ```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
```
^ 
Send all traffic for the user "jason" to the reviews:v2, meaning they'll only see the black stars. 
Difference to Kubernetes: Istio is on Service-level, Kubernetes more on Pod-level

---
# Canary Releases: A/B Testing

```zsh

istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml

istioctl replace -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml

#open BookInfo application and login as user jason (password jason)
open http://localhost/productpage
```

 * login as "jason" / "jason" leads to v2 (black stars)
 * anonymous user leads to v1 (no stars)

---
# Canary Releases: Rolling Upgrade

 ```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 50
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v3
      weight: 50
```
```zsh
istioctl replace -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-50-v3.yaml
```
^
The rule above ensures that 50% of the traffic goes to reviews:v1 (no stars), or reviews:v3 (red stars).

---
# Canary Releases: Blue/Green
 ```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v3
```
```zsh
istioctl replace -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-v3.yaml
istioctl get routerules
